I'm Xiang Li 李想 , a first year math PhD student of algebra and number theory in the University of Edinburgh working with Prof. Minhyong Kim . My interests are in algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry. To be more specific, I am interested in non-abelian Chabauty methods, which provide an efficient way to find rational points on a curve.   Am I the first person coming up with an idea to make the personal website look like a math book that contains definition\/remark etc.?   Contact me via s2132101@ed.ac.uk . And click here to see my CV (curriculum vitae). For more infos, click buttons on the sidebar.      The commutative diagram is called the Kim's cutter, which is Prof.Minhyong Kim's work and I'm trying to understand it.    The cursed curve, plotted using SageMath by Sachi Hashimoto    "
