I'm Xiang Li 李想 , a math PhD student of algebra and number theory in the University of Edinburgh working with Prof. Minhyong Kim since 2023. My interests are in algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry. To be more specific, I am interested in non-abelian Chabauty methods, which provide an efficient way to find rational points on a curve.     Am I the first person coming up with an idea to make the personal website look like a math book that contains definition\/remark etc.?     I can be contacted in the following ways:  Email: s2132101@ed.ac.uk  Github: lambdacdm       Just contact me if you wish!    In workdays, you can find me on the fifth floor of the Bayes Centre of the University of Edinburgh.
